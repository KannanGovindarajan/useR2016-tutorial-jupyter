The text is written in markdown, making it a rich format with inserting latex, links, images and html, too (because we're in a browser).  In 2014, there were 80,000 jupyter notebooks on github.  In 2015 the number almost tripled to 230,000.  This shows how popular and fast-growing the usage is in the community. "
